    <h1>Project On Console</h1>
    <p>A console application or command-line program is a computer program (applications or utilities) designed to be used via a text-only user interface, such as a text terminal, the command-line interface of some operating systems (Unix, DOS, etc.) or the text-based interface included with most graphical user interface</p>
    <p>The Console Screen is where I have written all of the codes and where it displays all of it. To open the Console Screen, click the right button of the mouse on the screen. Click on Inspect, followed by clicking on console.</p>
